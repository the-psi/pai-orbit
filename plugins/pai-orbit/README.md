# pai-orbit (plugin)

This directory is the pai-orbit plugin source. It is structured as a tool-agnostic `core/` plus per-tool `adapters/` that compile to `dist/`.

```

## Building

```bash
bash plugins/pai-orbit/build.sh
```

Each adapter clears its own `dist/<adapter>/` subdir and rebuilds from `core/`. The build is intended to be deterministic — `git status` after a no-op rebuild should be clean. If it isn't, the adapter is non-deterministic and should be fixed.

## Adapter fidelity

| Adapter | Modes | Skills | Agents | Hooks | Templates |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| claude-code | ✅ as `/commands/` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| cursor-plugin | ✅ rules + commands | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ mapped | ✅ |
| cursor (legacy) | ⚠️ as rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) | ⚠️ as one rule | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (verbatim) |
| copilot     | ⚠️ as instructions | ⚠️ as appendix | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| codex       | ⚠️ as instructions | ⚠️ as appendix | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

`⚠️` means "carried over as reference text only" — the receiving tool has no command/skill/agent invocation system. See each `dist/<adapter>/README.md` for specifics.

## Adding a new adapter

1. `mkdir plugins/pai-orbit/adapters/<tool>` and write a `build.sh`.
2. Read from `${CORE_DIR:-../../core}`, write to `${DIST_DIR:-../../dist/<tool>}`.
3. Emit a `dist/<tool>/README.md` documenting what was lossy.
4. The top-level `build.sh` auto-discovers it via `adapters/*/build.sh`.
